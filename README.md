My first repository

Hello People,
I am Aniruddha, I am a student at CSUEB who is currently trying to major in computer science.
I just recently learned that my method of learning based on classes is wrong and have decided
follow my own path as well as my schools.

// This is just a blurb for myself. Im going to start getting to work
